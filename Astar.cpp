 * Project 2 - 8 Puzzle Solver
 * This project will utilize the complete A* Algorithm
 * to solve an 8-puzzle. The program will use a total
 * of five h-functions on the given two initial states.
 * It will then create two tables, one for each state,
 * per heuristic function and print the execution time,
 * number of nodes generated, number of nodes expanded,
 * the depth of the tree, the effective branching factor,
 * and the total path taken.
